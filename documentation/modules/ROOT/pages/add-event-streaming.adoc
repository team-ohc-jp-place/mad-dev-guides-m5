= Adding Event Streaming capabilities to an application

== Introduction

To support the business requirement of capturing and processing user activity on the Globex Coolstuff application, two new services have been developed:

* *Activity Tracking service*: This service exposes a REST endpoint. User activities on the Globex website (such as opening a product page, liking a product etc.) generates an activity payload which is sent to the Activity Tracking REST endpoint. The service transforms this payload into a Kafka message which is sent to a topic on the Kafka broker.
* *Recommendation Engine*: This service consumes and processes the events produced by the Activity Tracking service. The service uses the Kafka Streams library to continuously determine the top featured products (the products which generate the most activities).
The service also exposes a REST endpoint to expose the list of featured products.

Both services are developed using Quarkus, the Quarkus extensions for reactive messaging and Kafka Streams. The development of the services is outside the scope of this workshop, but you are encouraged to examine the source code of the applications on GitHub: link:https://github.com/cloud-services-summit-connect-2022/activity-tracking-service[Activity Tracking Service,role=external,window=_blank] and link:https://github.com/cloud-services-summit-connect-2022/recommendation-engine[Recommendation Engine,role=external,window=_blank]

[#event-goals]
== Goals of this lab

In this part of the workshop you will connect the Activity Tracking and Recommendation Engine applications to the Apache Kafka broker using link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/connecting_applications_to_services/understanding-service-binding-operator.html[Service Binding,role=external,window=_blank].

You will be using the OpenShift Developer Console to configure the service binding. Note that these steps can also be achieved using the Red Hat OpenShift (`oc`) CLI.

== Step-By-Step Instructions

=== Explore the environment

. In a browser window, navigate to the console of the lab OpenShift cluster at link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/globex-%USERID%?view=graph[console^,role=external,window=openshiftconsole]. Login with your username and password (`%USERID%/openshift`). Open the *Developer* perspective in the *globex-%USERID%* namespace.
. In the Developer perspective, open the *Topology* view. Expect to see something like this (rearrange the topology as you see fit):
+
image::globex-deployment-topology.png[]
+
The deployed topology consists of:
+
** `globex-ui`: The Globex Coolstuff web application (Node.js/Angular). 
** `catalog` and `catalog-database`: The Globex Coolstuff catalog service, consisting of the catalog database and the Spring Boot catalog microservice.
** `inventory` and `inventory-database`: The Globex Coolstuff inventory service, consisting of the inventory database and the Quarkus inventory microservice.
** `activity-tracking`: The Activity Tracking service. Notice that the deployment of the service is scaled to zero. The service will be scaled up once the connection to the Kafka broker is set up.
**  `recommendation-engine`: The Recommendation Engine service. Notice that the deployment of the service is scaled to zero. The service will be scaled up once the connection to the Kafka broker is set up.
** `activity-tracking-simulator`: A Quarkus service that simulates user activity events and sends them to the Activity Tracking service.
** `kafka`: an instance of a Kafka broker, managed by the _AMQ Streams_ operator. In the Topology view, the kafka deployment shows up as a single unit, but in reality it consists of several deployments: a ZooKeeper (3 nodes) to manage and maintain the internal state of the Kafka broker, the Kafka broker itself (2 broker nodes) and the Entity operator, which manages topics and users.
** `kafdrop`: a web UI for viewing Kafka topics and browsing consumer groups. The tool displays information such as brokers, topics, partitions, consumers, and lets you view messages.

. Open the *Globex UI* application in a browser tab. To do so, click on the image:console-open-url.png[Open URL, 30, 30] icon next to the blue circle representing the *globex-ui* deployment in the Topology view. 
+
Alternatively, open a browser tab and navigate to link:https://globex-ui-globex-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/[globex-ui^, role=external,window=_blank]
+
Expect to see the home page of the Globex Coolstuff web application:
+
image::globex-coolstuff-home-page.png[]
. Click on *Cool Stuff Store* in the top menu to see a paginated list of products:
+
image::globex-coolstuff-product-page.png[]
. The _Featured_ pane on the home page is empty at the moment. Also the product list page has an empty bar above the product list. These elements will be populated once the recommendation engine is up and running. 

=== Create a Kafka Topic in the AMQ Streams Kafka broker

The first thing to do is to create a topic in the Kafka broker which will receive the user activity events generated on the Globex web site.

When using AMQ Streams, topics can be created by deploying a Kubernetes Custom Resource (CR), that will be processed by the Entity Operator of AMQ Streams, which will use the Kafka APIs to create the topic on the broker.

A custom resource can be created directly in the OpenShift console.

. On the OpenShift console, click on the image:console-import-yaml.png[] icon in the top menu on the right. This opens an editor where you can enter a Kubernetes resource definition in YAML or JSON format.

. Paste the following *KafkaTopic* Custom Resource in the editor.
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: kafka
  name: globex.tracking
  namespace: globex-%USERID%
spec:
  topicName: globex.tracking
  partitions: 1
  replicas: 2
  config: {}
----
+
Click *Create* to create the topic.
+
This creates a topic named *globex.tracking* with a single partition and two replicas, and default configuration (the *config* element allows you to define additional properties like message retention time and size etc...).

. The Kafdrop UI can be used to verify that the topic has been correctly created. In the Topology view of the *globex-%USERID%* namespace, click on the image:console-open-url.png[Open URL, 30, 30] icon next to the blue circle representing the *kafdrop* deployment.
+
Alternatively, open a browser tab and navigate to link:https://kafdrop-globex-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/[kafdrop^, role=external,window=_blank].

. This redirects you to the Kafdrop home page. Scroll down to see the list of topics. Expect to see the *globex.tracking* topics, which you just created.
+
image::kafdrop-landing-page.png[]
+
Click on the topic name to see the details of the topic. Notice that the topic has a single partition, and is empty at the moment.
+

=== Binding applications to Apache Kafka

In order for applications to be able to connect to a Kafka broker, the application needs to be configured with connection details like the Kafka bootstrap server URL, the security protocol and the user credentials. This is where link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/applications/connecting_applications_to_services/understanding-service-binding-operator.html[Service Binding,role=external,window=_blank] comes in. Service Binding allows to inject connection details from an e.g. secret directly into a pod. 

Binding applications to services using Service Binding requires the Service Binding operator to be installed on the OpenShift cluster. The operator has been installed on your OpenShift cluster.

. As part of the provisioning of the Kafka broker, a secret *kafka-client-secret* was created in the *globex-%USERID%* namespace. To view the contents of the secret, click on *Secrets* in the left menu of the Developer perspective. Make sure you are pointing to the *globex-%USERID%* namespace.

. In the list of secrets, locate the *kafka-client-secret* secret, and click on the name of the secret to open the secret details. Click on *Reveal values* to see the actual values stored in the secret.
+
image::openshift-console-secret.png[]

. To bind the *Activity Tracking service* and *Recommendation Engine* applications to the Kafka broker, create a *ServiceBinding* Custom Resource.
+
On the OpenShift console, click on the image:console-import-yaml.png[] icon in the top menu on the right. This opens an editor where you can enter a Kubernetes resource definition in YAML or JSON format.
+
Paste the following *ServiceBinding* Custom Resource in the editor.
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: kafka-servicebinding
  namespace: globex-%USERID%
spec:
  application:
    group: apps
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        service-binding/type: kafka
    resource: deployments
    version: v1
  bindAsFiles: true
  services:
    - group: ''
      kind: Secret
      name: kafka-client-secret
      version: v1
----
+
Click *Create* to create the Service Binding resource.
+
The Service Binding operator detects the creation of the Custom Resource, looks for deployments which are labeled with *service-binding/type: kafka* and injects the contents of the *kafka-client-secret* into the deployments. Both the *activity-tracking* and the *recommendation-engine* deployments have the expected label.

. Once the service binding is done, the status of the ServiceBinding Custom Resource moves to *Connected*.
+
image::openshift-console-service-binding-connected.png[]

. To check the injection of the secret by the Service Binding operator, navigate to the Topology view of the OpenShift console at link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/globex-%USERID%?view=graph[OpenShift Console^,role=external,window=openshiftconsole]. Click on the *activity-tracking* deployment to open the details pane, and click on the deployment name (above the Details, Resources and Observe tabs) to open the full details of the Deployment. 
+
image::openshift-console-topology-deployment-details.png[]
+
Scroll down to the *Volumes* section. Notice that the service binding occurs by injecting a secret into the pod:
+
image::service-binding-secret.png[]
+
Return to the Topology view.

. Scale the *activity-tracking* deployment to 1 replica. You can do so by clicking on the *activity-tracking* deployment in the Topology view, and in the details window select the *Details* tab, and click the arrow next to the circle to scale the deployment.
+
image::openshift-console-scale-deployment.png[]

. Check the logs of the *activity-tracking* pod, and notice that the pod successfully connects to the Kafka broker instance. +
To see the logs, click the *Resources* tab of the deployment, and click on the *View logs* link. +
+
image::openshift-console-pod-logs.png[]
+
Expect to see something like: 
+
----
[...]

----

. Go back to the Topology view, and scale up the *recommendation-engine* deployment to 1 pod.

. Once the *recommendation-engine* is up and running, check in the Kafdrop UI at link:https://kafdrop-globex-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/[kafdrop^, role=external,window=_blank] that a number of new topics have been created:
+
image::kafdrop-kafka-streams-topics.png[]
+
Those are the topics created by the Kafka Streams topology in the Recommendation Engine to calculate the top featured products based on activity events.


=== Testing the Globex Coolstuff application

Now that the Activity Tracking and Recommendation Engine apps are up and running, we can test the generation of activity events and the calculation of the top featured products.

The deployment topology for the workshop includes an activity simulator service which will generate a number of activity events randomly distributed over a list of products. These activity events are sent to the Activity Tracking service and transformed into Kafka messages in the `globex.tracking` topic. These messages are consumed by the Recommendation Engine app to calculate the top featured products.

. In a browser window, navigate to the Topology view of the lab's OpenShift cluster at link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/globex-%USERID%?view=graph[OpenShift Console^,role=external,window=openshiftconsole]. 
. Open the URL to the *activity-tracking-simulator* application by clicking the image:console-open-url.png[30,30] icon next to the blue circle representing the *activity-tracking-simulator* deployment. 
+
Alternatively, open a browser tab and navigate to link:https://activity-tracking-simulator-globex-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/[Activity Tracking Simulator, role=external,window=activity-tracking-simulator].
. This opens a Swagger UI page which allows you to use the REST API of the application. The REST application has only one operation, `POST /simulate`.
+
image::activity-tracking-simulator-swagger-ui.png[]
. Generate a number of activity events. Click the *Try it out* button, and set `count` to any value between 100 and 1000. Click *Execute*.

. You can use the Kafdrop UI to inspect the messages sent to the *globex.tracking* topic of the Kafka broker. +
Navigate to the Kafdrop UI at link:https://kafdrop-globex-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/[kafdrop^, role=external,window=_blank] and click on the *globex-tracking* topic in the topic list. Notice the activity event messages produced by the Activity Tracking service:
+
image::kafdrop-topic-messages.png[]
+
Click on the link of the only partition of this topic to see the list of messages. Click on the image:kafdrop-expand-message.png[] icon next to a message to see its content.
+
image::kafdrop-topic-messages-detail.png[]

. The featured product list calculated by the Recommendation Engine is produced to the *globex.recommendation-product-score-aggregated-changelog* topic. The list is recalculated roughly every 10 seconds as long as activity events are produced. Every calculation produces a message to the changelog topic. The last message in the topic represents the latest top featured list.
+
image::kafdrop-messages-aggregated-chainlog.png[]

. In a browser window, navigate to the home page of the Globex Coolstuff web application. Notice that the home page now shows a list of featured products.
+
image::globex-coolstuff-home-page-featured.png[]
+
Also, the product page now shows a banner with the featured products.
+
image::globex-coolstuff-product-page-featured.png[]

Congratulations! You reached the end of this part of the workshop, in which you added event streaming capabilities to the Globex Coolstuff application, using AMQ Streams, and Service Binding to connect your apps to the Kafka instance.
