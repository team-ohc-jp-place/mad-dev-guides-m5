== Globex Digital Transformation Journey

Globex is a fictitious retail company. The company recently started a digital transformation and cloud adoption journey. As part of this initiative, the development and devops teams have completed the modernization of the existing multi-tier monolithic retail e-commerce web application. The monolithic application was split in a couple of loosely-coupled microservices and the application was re-hosted on OpenShift.

A schematic overview of the current state of the application after the first phase of the application modernization effort:

To futher enhance the Globex Retail application, the business comes up with new requirements

* The ability to track user activity on the website and the mobile application.
* Highlight products which generate most customer interest as featured products.
* Provide a personalized experience for users on the website and mobile application.

== Challenges

Adoption of new technologies such as event streaming requires time and new skills, which are not readily available inside the company.

== Solution Approach
In order to cope with these challenges: +

* The team decides to use the Kafka ecosystem to track the user activity since it can scale 
* A preference for *managed cloud services* for an easy and rapid adoption of new middleware components like  Apache Kafka. 

This allows the teams to focus on the business requirements, without the need to invest in skills and infrastructure to deploy and maintain these components.


== Goals of this lab
In this module you will follow this journey:

* Setup managed Kafka through Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Kafka
* Add event streaming to the Globex retail application to track use activity 
* Use Kafka streams to then highlight featured products
* Once an order is placed, and the records are pushed into a Kafka topic, leverage Red Hat OpenShift Connectors to connect the Streams for Apache Kafka instance to a third party cloud service to e.g. process or analyze the orders. 


== Runtime Architecture

Visitors engage with the Globex retail website in a number of ways:

* view list of products
* search for products
* like a product / add a product to favourites
* view product details 
* add products to the shopping cart
* place an order

Each of these activities generate a stream of events which are captured by  the *User Activity Tracking* service. This service then pushes the events into the Kafka streaming platform. 
The events can then be consumed by other services such as the *Product Recommendation* service which powers the list of featured products.
A new *Featured Products* section is created in the front-end web application to showcase the top featured products. 


== Deployment Architecture

Here is a view of the deployment architecture

* All services and the website are deployed on Red Hat OpenShift running on the cloud
* The following services are  are running as fully managed and hosted services accessed through http://console.redhat.com[http://console.redhat.com^, window=redhatconsole]
** Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka
** Red Hat OpenShift Conectors
