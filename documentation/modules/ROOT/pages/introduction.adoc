== Globex Digital Transformation Journey

Globex is a fictitious retail company. The company recently started a digital transformation and cloud adoption journey. As part of this initiative, the development and devops teams have completed the modernization of the existing multi-tier monolithic retail e-commerce web application. The monolithic application was split in a couple of loosely-coupled microservices and the application was re-hosted on OpenShift.

A schematic overview of the current state of the application after the first phase of the application modernization effort:

To further enhance the Globex Retail application, the business comes up with new requirements

* The ability to track user activity on the website and the mobile application.
* Highlight products which generate most customer interest as featured products.
* Provide a personalized experience for users on the website and mobile application.

The team decides to use the Kafka ecosystem to track the user activity since it can easily scale. Red Hat AMQ Streams (based on the upstream Strimzi) provides a Kubernetes/OpenShift-centric view of Apache Kafka, providing operator-based installation and upgrades, and cloud-native management of brokers, topics and security.


== Goals of this lab
In this module you will follow this journey:

* Add event streaming to the Globex retail application to track user activity 
* Use Kafka streams to then highlight featured products


== Runtime Architecture

Visitors engage with the Globex retail website in a number of ways:

* View list of products
* Search for products
* Like a product / add a product to favourites
* View product details 
* Add products to the shopping cart
* Place an order

Each of these activities generate a stream of events which are captured by  the *User Activity Tracking* service. This service then pushes the events into the Kafka streaming platform. 
The events can then be consumed by other services such as the *Product Recommendation* service which powers the list of featured products.
A new *Featured Products* section is created in the front-end web application to showcase the top featured products. 


== Deployment Architecture

Here is a view of the deployment architecture

All services and the website are deployed on Red Hat OpenShift running on the cloud.
